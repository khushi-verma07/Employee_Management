# HR_Management
The HR Management project uses SQL and JDBC, featuring two user views: Employee and HR. Employees can view their data, apply for leave, and check approval status. HR approves/rejects leave, manages employee salary deductions, and handles employee recordsâ€”adding, modifying, or deleting employee details.
